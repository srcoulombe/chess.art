# README 
This repository contains the codebase used to generate custom line art from a chess game's [PGN string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation).

The app/e-commerce store is [live on anvil](https://U3V3TZDTASIQ6VSY.anvil.app/7JVMVS3N6L2FUVUBZJJJGEU2). 

The code saved here is currently being run through anvil's uplink. This is a temporary fix, and will be resolved once anvil approves the request to allow this custom code to be run from their servers.
